# UFO Analysis

## Overview

Using JavaScript, we've built a website that will filter Dana's UFO data. We will be able to filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape. We will also be able apply numerous filters at once for deeper analysis.

## Results:

To perform a search is quite easy. On the left side on the website is a section called "Filter Search"

Each search criteria has a placeholder, showing the kind of data you can search for.

If, for example, you only wanted to search for UFO sightings in New York State, you'd type 'ny' where is says 'Enter State' and press Enter

As you can see, this filtered the results to only show sightings from New York State.

You can search with multiple filters! For example, if I only wanted to find sightings in the US where the shape is a triangle, I would type 'us' into 'Enter Country' and 'triangle' into 'Enter Shape'.

## Summary:

One drawback of this website is that it does not take the comments section of the data into the filters. The comments are perhaps the most interesting part of the data as they describe the sightings that took place.

In order to improve upon this analysis, I would;
  - Create a search filter that would utilize the comments, being able to search for keywords or phrases.
  - Expand the data, as it only goes from January 1st-January 13th, 2010
